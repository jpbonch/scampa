# The Schools Clean Air Monitoring Project in Abingdon
The project is a partnership between 13 local primary and secondary schools in Abingdon. Children of all ages have participated, evaluating the equipment needed and establishing testing sites at their schools.

This program was made to help interpret the results from the particulate matter air quality tests, by plotting the data over time.
